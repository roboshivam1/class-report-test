Okay, I can analyze the provided transcript and extract the requested information. However, please note that the current transcript is extremely limited ("¡Hello, hello, hello, testing! ¡Hello, hello, testing!"). Based on this, I can only infer very basic information. If you provide a more substantial transcript, I can provide a much more detailed and accurate analysis.

Here's what I can extract:

1.  📘 **Topic Taught:** Potentially, the topic is related to **audio equipment testing or initial setup**, given the repeated "testing" phrase. It's impossible to know for sure without more context.

2.  **Subtopics Taught:**  None can be inferred from the provided text.

3.  **Exactly What All Things Were Done By The Teacher:** The teacher performed an **audio check**, likely to ensure the microphone and sound system were functioning correctly.

4.  📌 **Summary of the Class:**
    The class appears to have begun with the teacher conducting a sound check. This suggests the initial focus was on verifying the audio equipment. However, no actual teaching or content delivery is evident in the snippet. It is impossible to determine the class's subject or goal with just this introduction.

5.  📝 **Homework Assigned:** None.

6.  ✅ **Important Bullet Points:**
    *   Audio check initiated.
    *   Class content unknown.

7.  **Relevance of the Explanations to the Topic:** The audio check is relevant to ensuring that the lecture can be listened to by the students.

8.  **Any Irregularities or Problems in the Teaching:** The main problem is that there's no actual teaching in the transcript provided! It's solely a sound check. It is impossible to continue analyzing the content of the class without more context.
